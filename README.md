# html5-gulp-boilerplate
A handy boilerplate with some BrowserSync, Gulp/PostCSS and ES6 features. Basic tasks such as watch for scripts and styles 
have been set up.

1. Make sure that you have Gulp installed globally:

   npm install --global gulp-cli
   
2. In your project directory, run:

   npm install
   
3. Then run:

   gulp watch
   
4. Enjoy!
